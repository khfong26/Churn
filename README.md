# Customer Churn Prediction

This project predicts whether a customer is likely to leave a service (**churn**) based on their account attributes.  
It combines **data analysis, machine learning, and deployment** into an end-to-end solution.

## ðŸš€ Features
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
  - Cleaned and preprocessed raw customer data.
  - Visualized churn trends using graphs and statistical summaries.
- **Model Development:**
  - Trained multiple ML models including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Neural Networks.
  - Used **Keras** for deep learning experimentation.
- **Model Evaluation:**
  - Compared models using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.
  - Tuned hyperparameters to maximize predictive performance.
- **Deployment:**
  - Built a front-end interface for predictions.
  - Deployed on **Amazon AWS** for interactive use.

## ðŸ“Š Tech Stack
- **Languages & Libraries:** Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, Keras
- **Deployment:** Flask, AWS
- **Tools:** Jupyter Notebook, Git/GitHub

## ðŸ“ˆ Results
- Achieved strong predictive performance with the tuned models.
- Identified key factors influencing churn (e.g., contract type, monthly charges, tenure).
- Delivered an accessible front-end tool for real-time churn prediction.
